# 🩺 Breast Cancer Dataset Analysis
### 📌 Introduction
Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths globally, particularly affecting women. Early diagnosis and personalized treatment decisions are critical for improving patient outcomes. This project focuses on analyzing a breast cancer dataset to identify patterns in tumor stage, histology types, protein expression levels, and treatment options like surgery.

The dataset used contains 341 patient records, with features such as protein biomarkers, tumor stages, histology types, hormone receptor statuses, surgery dates, and patient outcomes.

### 🎯 Objective
The objectives of this analysis are:

To clean and preprocess the breast cancer dataset for effective analysis.

To explore the relationship between tumor stages, histology types, and protein expression.

To analyze surgical treatment options and how they correlate with tumor stages.

To investigate gender-based patterns and survival outcomes.

To derive insights that could be useful for early diagnosis and better treatment decisions.

### 🔍 Key Insights
Tumor Stage Distribution: Stage II tumors were the most common, followed by Stage III and Stage I.

Histology Type: Infiltrating Ductal Carcinoma was the most prevalent histological type.

Gender Bias: The vast majority of patients were female, with very few male patients recorded.

Surgery Trends: ‘Other’ and ‘Modified Radical Mastectomy’ were the most performed surgeries, especially for advanced stages.

Correlation of Proteins: Protein2 showed a moderate positive correlation with Protein1, while Protein3 had a negative correlation with Protein2.

Patient Status: Some patients with late-stage tumors were still marked as “Alive,” suggesting potential for successful intervention.

Time Between Surgery and Last Visit: A new feature was engineered to measure this gap in weeks, useful for understanding follow-up trends.

### 🧾 Conclusion
This analysis highlights the value of data-driven insights in healthcare. By understanding patterns in tumor characteristics and treatment decisions, healthcare professionals can design more effective strategies for diagnosis and treatment. Future work could involve predictive modeling using protein expressions and demographic data to anticipate patient outcomes.
