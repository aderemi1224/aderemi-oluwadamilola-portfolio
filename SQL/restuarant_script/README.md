# 📊 Restaurant Menu & Order Data Analysis
### 📝 Introduction
This project explores a restaurant's dataset containing two key tables — menu_items and order_details. The goal is to uncover meaningful business insights from historical menu and order data using SQL. The analysis aims to answer questions regarding menu pricing, item popularity, order behavior, and customer spending patterns.

The dataset includes:

A menu_items table containing information about dish names, categories, and prices.

An order_details table containing records of customer orders, including item IDs and order dates.

### 🎯 Objective
The primary objectives of this analysis are to:

Understand the composition of the restaurant's menu (pricing, category distribution, etc.).

Explore order trends and customer purchasing behavior.

Identify the most and least popular items on the menu.

Determine which orders generated the highest revenue.

Derive actionable insights that can help optimize menu offerings and pricing strategies.
